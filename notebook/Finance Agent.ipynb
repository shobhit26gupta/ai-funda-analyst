Avi Macquarie: Hi Yes, I just wanted to spend some time on the jewellery margin. Could you please help clarify this overhead management which you carried out this quarter and how sustainable are these gains? Essentially, the context is that despite a weakening mix, you have seen almost 12% standalone EBITDA margin and hence is there an upside possibility to that 11% to 11.5% range that you were indicating in prior to this quarter? Ashok Sonthalia: Avi, Ashok here. Actually 11.9% if you think about domestic jewellery business, it's kind of 11.6%. You can see in our disclosure that there has been higher primary for international  --- Page 6 ---  Titan Company Limited May 08, 2025   Page 5 of 19 business and they had some positive impact on the reported number. But 11.6% nevertheless had element of, small element of operating leverage as well as some hedging gains sitting it. Whenever robust growth happens, some element of operating leverage coming in the jewellery business is quite normal and which has happened. So it is not that extraordinary effort to squeeze out the normal cost which we need to invest for the growth of the jewellery business. It is just the scale going up for last 2-3 quarters has given that benefit. Of course, we have been mindful of what cost we are incurring and how we are incurring but it is combination of operating leverage as well as some hedging gain which you are seeing that studded ratio is slightly lower but still we are able to deliver. As far as coming to 11% to 11.5% margin guidance, I think that stays. We are not guiding you for any upside. Considering the uncertainty of gold prices and many, many uncertainties for future, 11% to 11.5% seems to be more reasonable to think about. Avi Macquarie: Got it, Sir. Fairly clear. Sir, and the second and last bit is on the demand side. Now, you did clearly allude towards the consumer behavior asking for more value, more making charge, and we have been able to deliver that in this quarter as well, it seems like. Now if I were to kind of look at this going forward for FY'26, how would you parse the growth? Are you in a scenario where the last year is giving you confidence of upwards of 15%, if you could give some sense on how should we look at the next year? That's all from my side. Ajoy Chawla: Sorry, what is 15%? Avi Macquarie: I mean, sales growth, sorry, jewellery sales growth. If you were to look at your earlier mid-year targets and what kind of is expected for the next few years on a simple average basis, it does imply the upwards of 15% to reach that 2.2x-2.5x. And that's the context where I was coming from. Ajoy Chawla: That's the derived figure. Okay. So I think demand outlook has been driven especially in this last quarter and even to an extent in Quarter 3 by the average ticket size growth which has certainly been influenced by the increase in gold prices and therefore buyer sentiment and buyer growths have been rather muted. Now how this will play out as we go forward very difficult, but certainly from our end we continue to target high double-digit growths, whether it comes in value, whether it comes out of buyer or ticket size or a combination of the two that is a very quarter-to-quarter fluctuating scenario, very difficult to predict. But certainly, we are targeting and we are preparing and aiming for these high double-digit growths. What turns out, of course, depends on the situation. Avi Macquarie: But, do you see international at risk because of this tariff talk, etc. or is that not anything to get so much to be bothered about? Ajoy Chawla: Diny will try and answer that for you.  --- Page 7 ---  Titan Company Limited May 08, 2025   Page 6 of 19 Kuruvilla Markose: Hi, this is Diny here. Tariffs, as of the way we are seeing things now in both in the US market, it's not really cost any significant thing, but that we have not taken any price increases as yet. We're waiting. We will watch how the whole situation unfolds and then basis that depending on what competition also does, it's quite likely that if tariffs go up, then we will take price increases. How that's going to play out? Will it mute demand? At this point in time, the view would be that it doesn't look likely. And it also looks like between India and the U.S. the bilateral trade agreement is progressing well and it looks that we will reach some kind of an agreement on that. Trump has just announced that he struck a deal with UK first and since India has already done a similar deal with UK, India and the US doing a deal looks quite likely. Avi Macquarie: Got it, fairly clear. I will come back in the queue for the other questions. Thank you.\", 'metadata': {'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Unknown'}}, {'chunk': \"Moderator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. First question is from the line of Manoj Menon from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead. Manoj Menon: Hi. first of all, good luck to Venkat for all the future endeavors and good luck to Ajoy as you take on the new role. Good luck and God bless to both. Couple of questions from my side on the jewellery business. One, given the incessant sort of price increase which you have seen in the gold commodity, just some snippets from you in terms of your research as well as anecdotal evidence on what the consumer telling you, right? So is the consumer cutting back on the volume side of it, is the consumer asking for more 18 carat? And more importantly, how do you see this evolving and what are the plans in place? That's the first one. Ajoy Chawla: Thanks, Manoj. Just reminding you that this is effective 1st Jan. So we have still way to go. But, thanks for your good wishes. And answering your question on what the consumer is saying, so 2-3 things are coming out and I am seeing this now for the last several months. As gold prices have kind of clipped up so sharply, we are seeing in the sub ₹50,000 price band, very specifically, more in gold and little bit in studded also, there is an impact on the consumer sentiment there. Now some of it is us vacating price points because simply gold price goes up, the same product goes into a certain higher price band. That is one part of the story. But there is  --- Page 4 ---  Titan Company Limited May 08, 2025   Page 3 of 19 continued, let's say customer sentiment in that lower price band where we are seeing some buyer being a little reticent. Second piece is yes, customers are more open to 18 carat gold, though we don't really have the full information as yet. We have just launched some collections in 18 carat gold in certain parts of the country for traditional customers as well and we hope that we will see good response. And I know that in CaratLane, we have launched something in 9 carats as well. So there is early traction and I think more and more customers are going to be open to lower caratage simply because the price point has become quite a bit. On the higher price bands, while there is buyer growth, we are seeing some of the customers actually scaling down the complexity of product they are willing to buy. So it means that if earlier they were open to buying a higher making charge product, they are sliding down a bit, but they are still buying a certain quantum of gold and a certain value. So there is some indications there. And if I were to answer your question on what are customers telling us in terms of our conversation, they certainly are feeling the pinch and therefore they are looking for solutions both on terms of lightweight jewellery, lower caratage jewellery as well as probably lower making charge jewellery. So, you know, they still want gold but they're looking at how they can manage it within their budgets. Manoj Menon: Understood. Thank you, Ajoy. Just one quick follow up and then I will have a second question. So the quick follow up here is if let's say in a hypothetical scenario because end of the day gold is just a commodity, if gold corrects 20%-30% and probably stays there, I know that it may not last for long. I am not taking a commodity view here. In the interim consumers may have moved from 22 (carat) to 18 (carat). Does it have some sort of, let's say an impact on your medium term, absolute revenue situation? Ajoy Chawla: Actually, we would welcome any gold price correction because a lot more customers will come in the market. Evidence of that was seen when the Finance Minister had reduced their duties last year and so many fence seaters kind of just jumped in. So it's the best situation to be in. It also helps us improve margins actually on various fronts. So actually we would welcome it and any value or ticket size drop being compensated by a jump in number of buyers is a fabulous situation to be in because we can cultivate them. Manoj Menon: That is fair one, sir. And quickly on the second one. As I understand the diamond prices, let's say in the wholesale market has declined materially over the last few years, whereas in the retail market, it is probably flat. Now I am thinking from a consumer point of view who let's say bought diamond from any jeweler 2-3 or 4 years back with an explicit or implicit understanding that I can actually come and exchange it at the market price. Now, is there a situation where consumers are coming and looking for an exchange and realizing that my diamond prices are not inflated at all, where gold and does that have any implication for let's say what he or she is buying today in an exchange? Is he preferring more gold over studded or diamonds rather? Ajoy Chawla: So one clarification that there are different behaviors in the Solitaire segment and specially the bigger sizes, 1 carat, 2 carat plus and then smaller carat sizes in Solitaire and then the small. More than 90-95% of studded business is non-Solitaire which means they are small. Have the  --- Page 5 ---  Titan Company Limited May 08, 2025   Page 4 of 19 prices really come down in wholesale market or in retail? No. In Solitaire, there's a different story. One carat plus, two carat plus in the wholesale, they have come down. But if I were to go back five years ago, somebody has bought vis-à-vis 5 years ago, the price has not really, I mean, it went up and it's come down. So the index, it's really difficult to kind of mathematically conclude it because it's to do with the type of diamond - fancy shaped, big, small spec, VVS, there are simply too many elements, but I am just giving an index feel to it. So this is at the wholesale level also and in retail certainly anybody who's bought diamonds from us from five years back is not going to experience a drop. They may say okay it's not really appreciated much. But somebody who's bought it 2 years back may think that the price has come down but actually that is more narrative in the media that he might be reading whereas when she comes to the store she may say there may be a 5%-6% impact. But coming to the question you asked because of this, let's say narrative or otherwise, if this perception exists are people saying let me go to gold, there is a bunch of people who are saying especially the high carat Solitaire buyer and there's a very small number by the way in the entire year that we sell to them. That customer has become a little wary of using the Solitaire big stone as a means of investment and therefore because the price volatility thing let's see where this settles and let's see if it starts firming up. So they are holding back. Are these guys going and buying gold? Some of them may be doing so. I don't have exact data to correlate. But we do know that some of our high lifetime value customers are all feeling gold is certainly the flavor at this point in time. And they have no hesitation in buying gold, whereas they may have some hesitation in buying the Solitaire. On Studded, small stones, I don't think this story is at all playing out the way we might be imagining. And that is more than 90% of the studded. So different stories sitting here and different kinds of segments and very, we are also leveraging that. And by the way, on the Solitaire side, smaller stone sizes, we are seeing a whopping increase in buyers. And at overall level, studded buyers is outpacing gold buyers, whether Solitaire or otherwise. Not now, but the last two quarters and it carries on into this month. April month also it has been that way. So actually, at a buyer level the story is different from the value level that we are seeing. I don't know if I answered you or confused you but I am just giving you 3-4 different insights. Manoj Menon: And I will have to listen to the transcript once again, sir. Thank you and good luck.\", 'metadata': {'speaker': 'Moderator', 'role': 'Unknown'}}, {'chunk': \"Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Arnab Mitra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Arnab Mitra: Hi, team, and congratulations on a great performance across all the businesses. My question, again was on studded. And where I am coming from is when you anecdotally speak to a lot of people who historically have owned diamonds, they are from rich families, that segment seems to almost suggest anecdotally that we are not going to buy diamond or they are going to buy much lesser of diamonds going ahead. But your growth rates, buyer growths are all very good. So are we like dealing with completely different sets of consumers here? Are you getting the growth from people who are buying diamond for the first time in your view? Just trying to understand this disconnect that, a lot of people feel between when you speak to anecdotally and versus actual numbers, which shows good growth for you. Ajoy Chawla: Yes, actually there are many segments and frankly some of us anecdotally speak to only some other people like us and they may be all, already diamond buyers and fairly well off and very evolved diamond buyers. And again, if you happen to be speaking to the type who's seeking Solitaire as an investment buy, then that's another sub-segment within them. So I would say that there are simply too many different segments and the segment whom you are referring to, the ones who buy diamonds for investment is a rather small percentage of the total studded buyers existing or even if I think of the penetration of, I mean amongst new of course, new studded buyers, there's a vast ocean out there. So I am not even saying, certainly there are new people coming in, but even existing studded segment, this is a rather small percentage of people that we may be anecdotally receiving such pieces of information from. And even they might be  --- Page 9 ---  Titan Company Limited May 08, 2025   Page 8 of 19 fluctuating in their behavior. When it comes to adornment, they may have no qualms in buying smaller stones etc. And when it comes to investment they may be having a different point of view. Arnab Mitra: Right. So from the data that you gave which is buyer growth being pretty strong that the fact that the value growth is not keeping up is purely a function of the fact that gold is a smaller component of the jewellery and therefore the unit price hasn't gone up as much as gold. Ajoy Chawla: No, buyer growth is higher in studded than gold. But gold has been rather, rather dull because of the sub ₹50,000 segment. Okay, now that's the only piece here. At the high value end, is there a customer for studded jewellery? Certainly. Value growth will come. It's a mix of both, I don't think, I cannot conclude that growth will come only in the lower end in studded and higher end in gold, nothing like that. There is opportunity in both, in fact India is premiumizing and there are lot more Indians who are happy to spend on high value studded as well. So, this is not a commentary of this piece at all. There is opportunity in both. I was just making the point even in the sub one lakh studded we are seeing, because of portfolio pla,y we are seeing an early double-digit growth which is not a commentary on what is happening on the higher value studded. Arnab Mitra: Got it. And my last question was just on this, we had obviously a lot of news around (gold) lease costs going out, going up during the quarter due to tariff speculation. So has it impacted the quarter in any way for you? And is there any lingering impact going forward on that? That would be my last question. Ashok Sonthalia: Of course, you are right that as a knee jerk reaction, gold on lease rate (GOL) has gone up almost doubled and more than doubled and it is settling down now. But more than that even gold price, you know, gold rate also impact our financing cost because now the same quantity of GOL is far more expensive 30%-40% and I have to pay interest on that 30%-40%. So just the rate increase had a small impact, but overall gold price increase has a larger impact for the full year as far as GOL interest cost is concerned. But the good news is that after that GOL rates have been settling down and I think they are now about 75-80 basis points above the historical number and we will see how does they play out in FY'26.
